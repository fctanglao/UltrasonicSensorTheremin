# Ultrasonic Sensor Theremin
## Motivation
- ### I created the theremin for a final assignment in my History of Technology in Music course at Cal Poly Pomona
- ### I was gifted the WeMos D1 R2 microcontroller by a friend who encouraged me to apply the skills I learned in school to real-life applications, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical experiences
- ### I chose to program my theremin in Arduino, because I've always wanted to learn how to use the IDE since I was in high school
