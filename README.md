# Ultrasonic Sensor Theremin
## Project Motivation
- ### I created the theremin for a final assignment in my History of Technology in Music course at Cal Poly Pomona
- ### I was gifted the WeMos D1 R2 microcontroller by a friend who encouraged me to apply the skills I learned in school to real-life applications, bridging theoretical knowledge with practical experiences
- ### I chose to program the theremin in Arduino, because I've always wanted to learn how to use the IDE since I was in high school
## Pin Mapping the WeMos D1 R2
### ![Mapping](https://github.com/fctanglao/UltrasonicSensorTheremin/blob/main/WeMos%20D1%20R2%20Pin%20Mapping.png)
- ### The WeMos D1 R2 pin mapping differs from standard Arduino boards like the Uno
- ### The WeMos D1 R2 uses the GPIO pin numbers of the ESP8266 chip, but the board labels some pins to match Arduino's style
- ### The diagram above is a pin map from [*this forum*](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/wemos-d1-r2-d0-a0-as-output-solved/589397)
## Drawing the Schematic
### ![Schematic](https://github.com/FrancisTanglao/UltrasonicSensorTheremin/blob/main/Ultrasonic%20Sensor%20Theremin%20Schematic.png)
- ### I drew the schematic for the theremin using Fritzing
## Breadboard Implementation
